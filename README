Alerts have been configured for DEVTEST(10.140.12.213) AND STAGING(10.140.215.225). Currently, I have enable SMS, SMTP and email alerts:
1. SMS is sent by the /bin/sms_script. It is defined by the line .exec("/bin/sms_script") in alert.txt. The curl statement in that file can be edited to add more comma seperated mobile numbers.
2. Mail is sent by kapacitor.It can be enabled and disabled in /etc/kapacitor/kapacitor.conf under SMTP. More recipients can also be added there.
3.Slack alerts are not working because of proxy.


For creating alerts,
1. Set up the rules in try.csv file. Specify the measurement name, field value, warning condition and critical condition.
2. Start kapacitor if it is not running.
3. run usingKapacitor.py while kapacitor is running. (After starting, kapacitor may take a couple of minutes before you can define a task or run usingKapacitor.py)
4. Everytime you need to make changes to try.csv, repeat above steps.


usingKapacitor.py script creates tick files (whose format is specified in alert.txt file) for each row in the csv file and saves them as file_#.tick (where # is the row number in csv file). It also defines tasks (a task is responsible for creating the alerts based on the specifications in the tick file) with names alert_# corresponding to each file_#.tick. Then all the tasks are enabled.
